# Lockd — Project Structure

## Layout

```
/
├── contracts/         # Solidity smart contracts (the protocol)
├── apps/web/          # Next.js web application (the product)
├── test/              # Smart contract tests (90+ tests)
├── scripts/           # Deployment scripts
├── reports/           # Security audit reports
├── artifacts/         # Compiled contract artifacts (generated)
└── typechain-types/   # TypeScript types from contracts (generated)
```

## Build Verification — ALWAYS

Every task must end with a passing build. No exceptions.

1. `npm run compile` — contracts compile without errors
2. `npm run build` (in `apps/web/`) — Next.js build passes
3. `npm run test` — all tests pass
